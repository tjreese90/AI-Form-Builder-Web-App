# OAuth 2 / OpenID Connect for JavaScript Runtimes

This software provides a collection of routines that can be used to build client modules for OAuth 2.1, OAuth 2.0 with the latest Security Best Current Practices (BCP), and FAPI 2.0, as well as OpenID Connect where applicable. The primary goal of this software is to promote secure and up-to-date best practices while using only the capabilities common to both browser and non-browser JavaScript runtimes.

## Features

The following features are currently in scope and implemented in this software:

- Authorization Server Metadata discovery
- Authorization Code Flow (profiled under OpenID Connect 1.0, OAuth 2.0, OAuth 2.1, and FAPI 2.0), with PKCE
- Refresh Token, Device Authorization, and Client Credentials Grants
- Demonstrating Proof-of-Possession at the Application Layer (DPoP)
- Token Introspection and Revocation
- Pushed Authorization Requests (PAR)
- UserInfo and Protected Resource Requests
- Authorization Server Issuer Identification
- JWT Secured Introspection, Response Mode (JARM), Authorization Request (JAR), and UserInfo
